# DjangoChatroom

This project is a prototype implementation of a real-time chatroom that has been developed using the Django web framework and JavaScript. The chatroom serves as a student project that demonstrates the capabilities of these technologies in creating interactive and engaging web applications. The chatroom allows users to communicate with each other in real-time, enabling them to exchange messages and engage in group discussions.

The use of the Django web framework provides a solid foundation for the backend of the chatroom, allowing for secure and reliable data storage and management. JavaScript has been utilized for the frontend of the chatroom, enabling dynamic and interactive user interfaces that enhance the user experience.
