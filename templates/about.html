        This project is a prototype implementation of a real-time chatroom that
        has been developed using the Django web framework and JavaScript. The
        chatroom serves as a student project that demonstrates the capabilities
        of these technologies in creating interactive and engaging web
        applications. The chatroom allows users to communicate with each other
        in real-time, enabling them to exchange messages and engage in group
        discussions.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The use of the Django web framework provides a solid foundation for the
        backend of the chatroom, allowing for secure and reliable data storage
        and management. JavaScript has been utilized for the frontend of the
        chatroom, enabling dynamic and interactive user interfaces that enhance
        the user experience.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The combination of these technologies has enabled the creation of a
        powerful and functional chatroom that can be easily scaled and
        customized. As a student project, this prototype implementation serves
        as an excellent learning tool for those interested in web development
        and real-time communication technologies. It demonstrates how modern web
        frameworks and programming languages can be utilized to create engaging
        and interactive web applications that meet the needs of users.
